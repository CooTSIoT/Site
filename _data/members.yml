  bio: Rafael Asenjo is Professor of Computer Architecture at the University of Malaga. He obtained a PhD in Telecommunication Engineering in 1997. His research interests include programming models, parallel programming, heterogeneous computing, parallelization of irregular codes and energy consumption. He has been using the Intel TBB library since 2008 and over the last ten years, he has focused on productively exploiting heterogeneous chips leveraging TBB as the orchestrating framework. In 2013 and 2014 he visited UIUC to work on CPU+GPU chips. In 2015 and 2016 he also started to research into CPU+FPGA chips while visiting the University of Bristol. He served as General Chair for ACM PPoPP'16 and as an Organization Committee member as well as a Program Committee member for several HPC related conferences (PPoPP, SC, PACT, IPDPS, HPCA, EuroPar, and SBAC- PAD). Along with Michael Voss and James Reinders he co-authored the latest book (open access) on Threading Building Blocks (Pro TBB). He is oneAPI Innovator, SYCL Advisory Panel member and ACM member.
