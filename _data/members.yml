  bio: Prof. Rafael Asenjo, is an expert in heterogeneous programming models, runtime techniques and software support tools for parallelization of irregular codes on multicore and heterogeneous architectures. He is one of the pioneers in the use and development of SYCL applications, and the parallel library oneTBB. He is Professor of Computer Architecture at the University of Malaga, where he obtained a PhD in Telecommunication Engineering in 1997. His research interests include programming models, parallel programming, heterogeneous computing, parallelization of irregular codes and energy consumption. He has been using the Intel TBB library since 2008 and over the last ten years, he has focused on productively exploiting heterogeneous chips leveraging TBB as the orchestrating framework. In 2013 and 2014 he visited UIUC to work on CPU+GPU chips. In 2015 and 2016 he also started to research into CPU+FPGA chips while visiting the University of Bristol. He served as General Chair for ACM PPoPP'16 and as an Organization Committee member as well as a Program Committee member for several HPC related conferences (PPoPP, SC, PACT, IPDPS, HPCA, EuroPar, and SBAC- PAD).

  bio: Dr. Denisa A. Constantinescu is a former PhD. student co-advised by IP and Co-IP, currently holding a Postdoc at the ESL under the supervision of Prof. Atienza. She defended her Thesis on July 2022. She worked on an epileptic detection application based on ML for the ULP multi-core heterogeneous platform developed by the ESL. Her focus is to identify crucial architectural parameters to enable efficient execution of the algorithms of interest, while at the same time minimizing the energy consumed, and later on, to collaborate in the definition of the multi-core structure of the platform to ensure that the applications are executed with the minimum energy consumption.
